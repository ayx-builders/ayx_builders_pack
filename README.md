### Community

These tools are not an official Alteryx release and as such they have not been through the full testing process that tools in the product have. We do our best, but offer no guarantee of extended functionality. Just like CReW, some of them are prototypes and experimental, but that is some of what makes them so fun!  

If you find an issue let us know either by logging an issue here in GitHub, in the comments below or drop me personally a note and I'll take a look, or if you can see how to fix it yourself then even better!
